Best Wireless Earbuds 2017 – Reviews & Buyer’s Guide.</strong>
</h1>
<br>
<span>
When it comes to buying wireless earbuds, the experience is a little different than purchasing wired headphones.

When buying decent wired headphones you don’t need to have a bunch of specifics in your head. You need to remember technical details like impedance and size of drivers, but that’s about it.

	<strong>Our Recommendation</strong>
</h1>
<br>
Jaybird is a company that has perfected the art of wireless earphones. Their earphones have been around for years, and the X series is known for being one of the best. Although Jaybirds can be pricier than other competitors, they justify prices by delivering some great features.

We are looking at their latest creation, the Jaybird X3. The X3s are the third iteration in the series which has enjoyed much success. For starters, you are getting the same incredible sweat-proof design with some decent upgrades.<br>
<div class="red-box">In case you are wondering what the main differences are between the X2 and X3, the X3 is smaller than the X2s. The inline microphone has gotten a change in design, and the device has a new battery aimed at providing a better battery life.
</div><br>
Since Logitech owns Jaybird now, some tweaks have occurred in the 6mm drivers.  Expect better sound in the X3’s. As far as their performance goes, the Jaybirds X3 may be one of the best sounding wireless earphones we’ve tested. However, if you’re used to a fuller sound signature, you may not find it here since these are just wireless earphones.

The earphones also provide adequate noise cancellation. However, this may be a safety concern for runners because they manage to block out a fair amount of noise from the outside world. These wireless earphones come with a nice carrying pouch too.

Overall, the Jaybird X3 are a pair of wonderful wireless earphones. They sound fantastic and are easy to carry. However, there is one downside, we would like them to be more comfortable.
If you are a runner that wants to listen to music without the hassle of wires, the Jaybird X3’s are great.

<h1><strong>Wireless Earphones – Buyer’s Guide</strong>

<strong>A lot of people question the legibility of wireless earbuds and have gone to the point of bashing them by stating wireless earbuds don’t offer any real benefits.
</strong>
Sure, the sound quality isn’t as good as their wired counterparts, but to say wireless earbuds aren’t any good is severely wrong.

Wireless earbuds and headphones used to suffer from a lot of problems in the past, but they have become comparatively better in the modern-day and age.

We have several latest technologies like Apt-X, as well as the energy-efficient Bluetooth standards.

To be fair, wireless audio equipment is a lot closer to their wired counterpart than it used to be in the old days. With that out of the way, we are going to take a look at some of the advantages of buying wireless earbuds.

These benefits will help you in understanding that wireless earbuds aren’t terrible. These earbuds are for people who want to be active or don’t like to have wires in their way.
