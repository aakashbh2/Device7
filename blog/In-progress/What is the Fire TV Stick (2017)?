Amazon Fire TV Stick (2017) – Design and build

The Amazon Fire TV Stick looks a bit like a memory stick on steroids and is designed to plug straight into an HDMI port on your TV. It’s a neat all-in-one design housed in plastic. It will creak a little if squeezed, but feels tough enough for purpose.

At 3.4 inches long, it will need a bit of room on your TV back panel though, particularly when you consider making room for its micro USB cable power supply. Thankfully if this is too much of a squeeze, Amazon includes an HDMI extender in the box to free up some space.
The accompanying remote is pretty simple, offering a D-pad for navigation, a handful of playback controls and the all-important voice input key. It’s nice that this is included now, although the iOS and Android app does an equally good job and can activate the same Alexa commands.

Setting up your Fire TV Stick is really simple. Just plug it into a spare HDMI slot on your TV, and its USB cable into a power source. Some on-screen instructions will get your Alexa remote paired and the Fire TV Stick hooked up to your home network. Once you’re signed into your Amazon account, you’re ready to go.

The idea is that the Fire TV Stick will learn your viewing habits over time and tailor this to you, with video teasers to draw you in.
